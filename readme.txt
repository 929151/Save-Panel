===================

Before installing, make sure any old Save Panel files have been removed.


Photoshop CS 6 / CC
-------------------

1. Copy the Save Panel directory (residing in the "panel" directory) to 
   <Photoshop>/Plug-ins/Panels.

   Leaving you with: <Photoshop>/Plug-ins/Panels/Save Panel.

2. Run Photoshop and show the panel by going to Window/Extensions/Save Panel.


Photoshop CS 5
--------------

The steps are similar for CS5, but you need a few extra steps:

1. Copy the Save Panel directory (residing in the "panel" directory) to 
   <Photoshop>/Plug-ins/Panels.

2. Copy the Save Panel directory (residing in the "scripts" directory) to
   <Photoshop CS5>/Presets/Scripts.

   Leaving you with: <Photoshop>/Presets/Scripts/Save Panel.

3. Start Photoshop as administrator.

4. Go to run the Save Panel CS5 Fix script from File > Scripts > Save Panel CS5 Fix
   This step will fail if you do not run Photoshop with administrator rights.

5. Run Photoshop and show the panel by going to Window/Extensions/Save Panel.
